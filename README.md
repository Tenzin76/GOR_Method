# GOR_Method
implements the GOR method to predict secondary structure of protein sequence
Trains 1200 DSSP files containg protein sequences and secondary structures to create scoring matrix for Alpha (H), Extend (E), and Other (-) conformation
Uses the three scoring matrix to predict the seondary structure of a given protein sequence
